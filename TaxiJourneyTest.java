/**
 * This Test class called TaxiJourneyTest() is an implementation of test program to test the concepts and approach created in the class TaxiJourney().
 * 
 * The Concept here uses multiple concepts that is used as a real life implementation of taxi bookings.
 * The Following Program asks the user for instant booking initially and if the user chooses yes the the user enter the booking details 
 * the program reads the user inputs with the help of a Scanner that reads keyboard inputs. 
 * Concept 1 - Based on the booking date the program 1st checks if it is a holiday or not which is if system date is not 25th December or 1st January. if the date of the system booking is a holiday then the 
 * program calculates fare that have been predefined on the class "TaxiJourney" for holiday fares.
 * Concept 2 - Based on the booking date if the system date is not a holiday that is not 25th December or 1st January the the program
 * checks the booking time. 
 * Concept 3 -If the booking time or system time  is less than 8pm or 20.00 pm then the journey fare will be calculated according to the predefined fare values in the class "TaxiJourney"
 * for day fares. 
 * Concept 4 -If the booking time or system time is more than 8pm or 20.00 pm then the journey fare will be calculated according to the predefined fare values in the class "TaxiJourney" 
 * for night fares.
 * Concept 5- If The User initially chooses not book instantly but to book for a later date or future date then the booking is done by the user entering the booking details
 * which the system interprets using the scanner. The fare calculation in this case is done in regular fare method as defined by the day fare values in the class "TaxiJourney" 
 * Concept 6 -If the user neither wants to book instantly nor for a future date and chooses no then the program redirects the user to site or program details like disclaimer, policies, career opportunities, etc. 
 * Each Booking and Fare Calculation is Accompanied by the console output and an output file generated by the program in the specified path as a backup for the booking 
 * details for future reference.
 * To achieve all the concepts mentioned the Program uses multiple Nested If Else and Else If Loops to check conditions which is also called conditional looping.
 * Please Most of the loops are recursive and repeatitive so the documentation is stated for the initial part and for the repetitive part the documanetation of notion of repeatation is provided.
 * Every booking confirmation is also providing a Random booking reference number and driver details that is fed into the program initially.
 * except for future date bookings drivers details are not shared as the concept will be irrational.
 * The approach in this program was kept to be entirely ethical and has no implementation of immoral concepts.
 * This Program is Prototype or Beta Release so there may be a few bugs. Any such occurrence should be immediately e-mailed with details and  
 * if possible screenshots to "p2512726@my365.dmu.ac.uk"
 * 
 * Thank You
